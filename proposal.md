**Choice of game**

Memory Card Game.

**Project description**

The game will start with all the cards faced down and player/players take turns to turn over two cards. If two of the selected cards have the same picture, the game keeps those cards, otherwise it turns the cards face down again. The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken. The goal is to match most pairs of cards.

**User stories**

**MVP goals**
1. I want the game to be able to keep track of matched cards.
2. I want the player to be able to reset and start a new game once all the cards have been matched and the time has been recorded.

**Stretch goals**
1. I would like to add background sounds when a card is selected, as well as a background sound for the player's victory after all the cards have been matched.
2. I want the game to be able to record the time taken to match all cards.
3. Possibly add different modes (single player/multiplayer).
4. Possibly add different levels of difficulty (easy/medium/hard). The amount of cards will vary depending on the level.
