# Memory-Card-Game

I built this simple yet entertaining game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first class project. Memory Card Game will help you to improve your visual recognition and concentration!

## Overview

The Memory Card Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

In this digital version, the game board consists of a number of cards each displaying one side initially. When a card is clicked, an image is revealed. The player needs to remember the image as they continue to select other cards, trying to find a match.

## Gameplay

When the game begins, the player is presented with a board filled with cards faced down. The player can click on two cards during each turn:

- If the cards match, they will stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, they will flip back after a short moment.
The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards with as few moves as possible.

## Next Steps

Here are some planned future enhancements for the Memory Card Game:

- **Sound Effects and Background Music:** Add sound effects for card flips and matches, and victories to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Game Timer:** Add a game timer feature that will record the time taken for a player to match all cards. This will increase the competitive nature of the game and enable players to challenge themselves to beat their previous records.
- **Single Player/Multiplayer Modes:** I am considering the introduction of different game modes. This will include a single-player mode, where an individual can play against the clock, and a multiplayer mode, where players can challenge friends to see who can complete the game in the shortest time.
- **Difficulty Levels:** To implement different levels of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). The number of cards will vary depending on the selected difficulty level, adding an extra layer of challenge and replayability to the game.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates to your favorite Memory Card Game!
